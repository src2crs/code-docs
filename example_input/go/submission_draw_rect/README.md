# Task Submission: Draw a Recangle

This is a Go module containing a file with a submission that
might have been handed in by a student for the `draw_rectangle` task.

*Note*: This is the same code as used in the task example.
However, the comments used to describe different parts of this
source file are different.

*Note*: A more complete example that contains an exam definition including
solutions, extra tests, and submissions is provided separately.
