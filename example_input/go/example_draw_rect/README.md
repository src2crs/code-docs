# Example: Draw a Recangle

This is a Go module containing a file with an task that shows
how to draw a rectangle on the command line.

*Note*: This is the same code as used in the task example.
However, the comments used to describe different parts of this
source file are different.

* The line `EXAMPLE[loop_draw]` marks the start of an example
  and defines a tag `loop_draw` for it.
* The line `EXAMPLE_END` closes the example.
  *Note*: Such an `EXAMPLE_END` could also have a tag in case there are overlapping examples.
* The line `REMARKS[loop_draw]` add notes.
  The tag is mentioned here again to link the notes to the example.
  This way, comments don't have to be put into the source code,
  but may later be published with the source code anyway.
